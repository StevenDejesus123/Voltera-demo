The sales price was reported at $41,350,000 or $84,47/SF of land, since it sold for land value only. The subject property was not listed on the market for sale; therefore, the sale was an off-market transaction. The seller, AT&T , is leasing back the property, but we were unable to verify the terms of their lease. The property contains no deferred maintenance. The sale was an all cash transaction.\n\nThe property is located close to a densley populated area. It is rare for low coverage 11-acre sites to become available in this market.\n\nThe motivation for the seller was to balance out their books.\n\nThe motivation for the buyer was most likely to eventually redevelop the property. With the vacancy rate at 2% in the central submarket, demand is strong for high-quality industrial real estate. Located minutes from downtown Los Angeles, the site at Yates Ave. provides immediate access to Interstate 5, the 710 Freeway, and the highly dense urban core. In addition, it offers long-term opportunities for flexible design and multiple uses.",
